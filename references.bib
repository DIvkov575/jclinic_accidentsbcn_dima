	abstract = {Clustering is an essential tool in data mining research and applications. It is the subject of active research in many fields of study, such as computer science, data science, statistics, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Several clustering techniques have been proposed and implemented, and most of them successfully find excellent quality or optimal clustering results in the domains mentioned earlier. However, there has been a gradual shift in the choice of clustering methods among domain experts and practitioners alike, which is precipitated by the fact that most traditional clustering algorithms still depend on the number of clusters provided a priori. These conventional clustering algorithms cannot effectively handle real-world data clustering analysis problems where the number of clusters in data objects cannot be easily identified. Also, they cannot effectively manage problems where the optimal number of clusters for a high-dimensional dataset cannot be easily determined. Therefore, there is a need for improved, flexible, and efficient clustering techniques. Recently, a variety of efficient clustering algorithms have been proposed in the literature, and these algorithms produced good results when evaluated on real-world clustering problems. This study presents an up-to-date systematic and comprehensive review of traditional and state-of-the-art clustering techniques for different domains. This survey considers clustering from a more practical perspective. It shows the outstanding role of clustering in various disciplines, such as education, marketing, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. It also discusses the application of clustering to different fields attracting intensive efforts among the scientific community, such as big data, artificial intelligence, and robotics. This survey paper will be beneficial for both practitioners and researchers. It will serve as a good reference point for researchers and practitioners to design improved and efficient state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.},

	abstract = {Background: 
          This study aimed to evaluate the economic impact of traffic accidents in Spain during 1997.
          Methods: 
          The cost-of-illness method was used. Direct costs were divided into health services costs, insurance administration costs, and the costs of the material damages to the vehicles. Indirect costs were obtained through transformation of physical units into monetary units using the approach based on the human capital theory.
          Results: 
          The total cost of traffic accidents was 6,280.36 million euros, which amounts to 157.59 euros for each inhabitant in Spain and represents 1.35\% of the gross national product. The total direct cost was 3,397.00 million euros, representing 54.1\% of the total cost. The total indirect cost was 2,883.36 million euros, accounting for 45.9\% of the total cost.
          Conclusions: 
          The high socioeconomic cost of traffic accidents clearly indicates the need for the different administrations in Spain to collaborate in implementing preventive measures.},

	abstract = {Traffic accidents are one of the most important concerns of the world, since they result in numerous casualties, injuries, and fatalities each year, as well as significant economic losses. There are many factors that are responsible for causing road accidents. If these factors can be better understood and predicted, it might be possible to take measures to mitigate the damages and its severity. The purpose of this work is to identify these factors using accident data from 2016 to 2019 from the district of Setúbal, Portugal. This work aims at developing models that can select a set of influential factors that may be used to classify the severity of an accident, supporting an analysis on the accident data. In addition, this study also proposes a predictive model for future road accidents based on past data. Various machine learning approaches are used to create these models. Supervised machine learning methods such as decision trees (DT), random forests (RF), logistic regression (LR), and naive Bayes (NB) are used, as well as unsupervised machine learning techniques including DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering. Results show that a rule-based model using the C5.0 algorithm is capable of accurately detecting the most relevant factors describing a road accident severity. Further, the results of the predictive model suggests the RF model could be a useful tool for forecasting accident hotspots.},

	abstract = {Road traffic accidents are a major public health concern that continues to threaten the safety of individuals worldwide. These incidents result in many injuries, disabilities, and fatalities, which not only cause immense pain and suffering to victims and their loved ones but also sig- nificantly impact society as a whole. Consequently, it could be useful to identify patterns that can help define and implement effective preventive measures. In this context, this project aims to study traffic accidents in Barcelona between 2021 and 2022, using available data from Open Data BCN. The project will apply clustering, a powerful technique that can identify patterns in data. Specif- ically, various experiments will be conducted to detect the main characteristics of the studied accidents and obtain relevant profiles. These profiles will be analyzed to prevent similar incidents in the future. The programming language used in this thesis is Python to achieve these clusters and conduct the analysis. It offers a rich set of data processing, analysis, and visualization tools, making it a highly suitable choice for the proposed project. Overall, this project aims to apply clustering to gain a deeper understanding of traffic accidents in Barcelona, with the ultimate goal of contribute to the prevention of similar incidents in the future},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new adaptive data analysis method to study trend and instantaneous frequency of nonlinear and nonstationary data. This method is inspired by the Empirical Mode Decomposition method (EMD) and the recently developed compressed (compressive) sensing theory. The main idea is to look for the sparsest representation of multiscale data within the largest possible dictionary consisting of intrinsic mode functions of the form {a(t)cos(θ(t))}, where a∈V(θ), V(θ) consists of the functions smoother than cos(θ(t)) and θ′⩾0. This problem can be formulated as a nonlinear l0 optimization problem. In order to solve this optimization problem, we propose a nonlinear matching pursuit method by generalizing the classical matching pursuit for the l0 optimization problem. One important advantage of this nonlinear matching pursuit method is it can be implemented very efficiently and is very stable to noise. Further, we provide an error analysis of our nonlinear matching pursuit method under certain scale separation assumptions. Extensive numerical examples will be given to demonstrate the robustness of our method and comparison will be made with the state-of-the-art methods. We also apply our method to study data without scale separation, and data with incomplete or under-sampled data.}

abstract = {A survey of a convenience sample of 198 students at the University of Texas at El Paso was used to determine if sex differences in attitudes toward the task of driving could be detected. Males reported more behaviors than females that would put them at higher risk of collision—like driving under the influence and in vehicles with high centers of gravity. In addition, men expressed more comfort than women for driving at night, in unfamiliar territory and in bad weather. There was also some evidence of higher driving exposure for males than females. Women were more likely than men to report compliance with traffic regulations: using turn signals and obeying speed limits. Overall, it appears than men have more confidence in their driving skills than women. This confidence of males may reflect more of a belief in their superior driving skills rather than any disregard for the risks involved in operating a motor vehicle.}

Despite the existence of generally mixed evidence on the effect of traffic parameters, a few patterns can be observed. For instance, traffic flow seems to have a non-linear relationship with accident rates, even though some studies suggest linear relationship with accidents. On the other hand, increased speed limits have found to have a straightforward positive relationship with accident occurrence. Regarding weather effects, the effect of precipitation is quite consistent and leads generally to increased accident frequency but does not seem to have a consistent effect on severity. The impact of other weather parameters on safety, such as visibility, wind speed and temperature is not found straightforward so far. The increasing use of real-time data not only makes easier to identify the safety impact of traffic and weather characteristics, but most importantly makes possible the identification of their combined effect. The more systematic use of these real-time data may address several of the research gaps identified in this research.}

abstract = {Traffic accident frequency has been decreasing in Japan in recent years. Nevertheless, many accidents still occur on residential roads. Area-wide traffic calming measures including Zone 30, which discourages traffic by setting a speed limit of 30 km/h in residential areas, have been implemented. However, no objective implementation method has been established. Development of a model for traffic accident density estimation explained by GIS data can enable the determination of dangerous areas objectively and easily, indicating where area-wide traffic calming can be implemented preferentially. This study examined the relations between traffic accidents and city characteristics, such as population, road factors, and spatial factors. A model was developed to estimate traffic accident density. Kernel density estimation (KDE) techniques were used to assess the relations efficiently. Besides, 16 models were developed by combining accident locations, accident types, and data types. By using them, the applicability of traffic accident density estimation models was examined. Results obtained using Spearman rank correlation show high coefficients between the predicted number and the actual number. The model can indicate the relative accident risk in cities. Results of this study can be used for objective determination of areas where area-wide traffic calming can be implemented preferentially, even if sufficient traffic accident data are not available.}

ABSTRACT = {Driven by the high social costs and emotional trauma that result from traffic accidents around the world, research into understanding the factors that influence accident occurrence is critical. There is a lack of consensus about how the management of congestion may affect traffic accidents. This paper aims to improve our understanding of this relationship by analysing accidents at 120 intersections in Adelaide, Australia. Data comprised of 1629 motor vehicle accidents with traffic volumes from a dataset of more than five million hourly measurements. The effect of rainfall was also examined. Results showed an approximately linear relationship between traffic volume and accident frequency at lower traffic volumes. In the highest traffic volumes, poisson and negative binomial models showed a significant quadratic explanatory term as accident frequency increases at a higher rate. This implies that focusing management efforts on avoiding these conditions would be most effective in reducing accident frequency. The relative risk of rainfall on accident frequency decreases with increasing congestion index. Accident risk is five times greater during rain at low congestion levels, successively decreasing to no elevated risk at the highest congestion level. No significant effect of congestion index on accident severity was detected.},

For this reason, there is a continuing transportation investment in our country. Transportation investment is projected and implemented based on requirements of the next 20 years. Hourly, daily, monthly and annual variations in expected traffic flow are important in the determination of road standards. There are some accepted changes in traffic flow; for example, traffic is more dense during daylight than it is at night; during holidays traffic is more dense out of cities than it is within cities; but on weekdays it is more crowded within city than it is out of cities; and there are more vehicles on roads in summer months than in winter months. In this study, 1573 traffic accidents that occurred in Eskisehir in 2009 are reviewed according to their time of occurrence, and the relationship between number of accidents and occurrence times is examined. Finally, in order to prevent accidents, possible precautions are stated considering that relationship.

It considered classifiers such as naïve Bayes, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbour, AdaBoost, support vector machine, random forest, and five missing data methods. These classifiers were evaluated using five evaluation metrics: accuracy, root-mean-square error, precision, recall, and receiver operating characteristic curves. Furthermore, the assessment involved parameter adjustment and incorporated dimensionality reduction techniques. The empirical results and analyses show that the RF classifier, combined with multiple imputations by chained equations, yielded the best performance when compared with the other combinations.},

abstract = {Advances in recent techniques for scientific data collection in the era of big data allow for the systematic accumulation of large quantities of data at various data-capturing sites. Similarly, exponential growth in the development of different data analysis approaches has been reported in the literature, amongst which the K-means algorithm remains the most popular and straightforward clustering algorithm. The broad applicability of the algorithm in many clustering application areas can be attributed to its implementation simplicity and low computational complexity. However, the K-means algorithm has many challenges that negatively affect its clustering performance. In the algorithm’s initialization process, users must specify the number of clusters in a given dataset apriori while the initial cluster centers are randomly selected. Furthermore, the algorithm's performance is susceptible to the selection of this initial cluster and for large datasets, determining the optimal number of clusters to start with becomes complex and is a very challenging task. Moreover, the random selection of the initial cluster centers sometimes results in minimal local convergence due to its greedy nature. A further limitation is that certain data object features are used in determining their similarity by using the Euclidean distance metric as a similarity measure, but this limits the algorithm’s robustness in detecting other cluster shapes and poses a great challenge in detecting overlapping clusters. Many research efforts have been conducted and reported in literature with regard to improving the K-means algorithm’s performance and robustness. The current work presents an overview and taxonomy of the K-means clustering algorithm and its variants. The history of the K-means, current trends, open issues and challenges, and recommended future research perspectives are also discussed.}

This chapter introduces the basic concepts of data preprocessing and the methods for data preprocessing are organized into the following categories: data cleaning, data integration, data reduction, and data transformation. Data have quality if they satisfy the requirements of the intended use. There are many factors comprising data quality, including accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, believability, and interpretability. There are several data preprocessing techniques. Data cleaning can be applied to remove noise and correct inconsistencies in data. Data integration merges data from multiple sources into a coherent data store such as a data warehouse. Data reduction can reduce data size by, for instance, aggregating, eliminating redundant features, or clustering. Data transformations (e.g., normalization) may be applied, where data are scaled to fall within a smaller range. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of mining algorithms involving distance measurements. These techniques are not mutually exclusive; they may work together. For example, data cleaning can involve transformations to correct wrong data, such as by transforming all entries for a date field to a common format. The different attribute types and data characteristics can help identify erroneous values and outliers, which will be useful in the data cleaning and integration steps. Data processing techniques, when applied before mining, can substantially improve the overall quality of the patterns mined and/or the time required for the actual mining.}

abstract = {This paper reviews the evidence relevant to the hypotheses that young (16–25) drivers (a) are at greater risk of being involved in a casualty accident than older drivers and (b) this greater risk is primarily a function of their propensity to take risks while driving. The first hypothesis is clearly supported by epidemiological research even when controlling for differences in the quantity and quality of road travel and driving experience. The second hypothesis is also supported by observational and self-report surveys of driving behaviour. Some of the research and theory bearing on risk perception and risk utility, possible mediators of risk-taking, is also reviewed.}

  abstract  = "t-distributed Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (t-SNE), a
               clustering and visualization method proposed by van der Maaten
               \& Hinton in 2008, has rapidly become a standard tool in a
               number of natural sciences. Despite its overwhelming success,
               there is a distinct lack of mathematical foundations and the
               inner workings of the algorithm are not well understood. The
               purpose of this paper is to prove that t-SNE is able to recover
               well-separated clusters; more precisely, we prove that t-SNE in
               the `early exaggeration' phase, an optimization technique
               proposed by van der Maaten \& Hinton (2008) and van der Maaten
               (2014), can be rigorously analyzed. As a byproduct, the proof
               suggests novel ways for setting the exaggeration parameter
               $\alpha$ and step size $h$. Numerical examples illustrate the
               effectiveness of these rules: in particular, the quality of
               embedding of topological structures (e.g. the swiss roll)
               improves. We also discuss a connection to spectral clustering
               methods.",

Therefore, a composite test score cannot be obtained by simple addition or averaging of scores in the individual tests. However, if performances in individual tests are converted to Z scores, the Z scores can be added or averaged to yield a composite score that can be interpreted or processed using conventional statistical methods. This article explains in simple ways how Z scores are calculated, what the properties of Z scores are, how Z scores can be interpreted, and how Z scores can be converted into other standard scores.},
